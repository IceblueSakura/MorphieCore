# Roadmap

This page owns direction and current scope. Code and tests define behavior; [Architecture](architecture.md) records design decisions. Remove completed slices here; Git keeps history.

## Current focus

Complete the Generation IR against selected semantics accepted by the official OpenAI, Anthropic and Google APIs. Provider dialects remain codec concerns. Realtime and standalone tasks do not need complete integration for this phase. Each slice must state its goal and exit condition before code changes.

Track semantic expression, codec representation and enabled bindings separately. A concept supported by only one official API may belong in the IR; other targets reject it when they have no carrier. Client compatibility does not define the semantic vocabulary. Protocol sources are pinned in [References](references.md).

No slice is selected. Until the IR core is complete, add only minimal regressions for changed contracts and confirmed defects, preferably by extending existing tests. Keep safety invariants and the offline baseline; defer coverage expansion.

### Deferred Generation semantics

These are explicit gaps, not claims of complete official API coverage:

- Messages citations (1C) are deferred to Claude Code acceptance; requests and responses that carry them are rejected, not dropped. The [design](#1c-design-messages-citations) records the IR change for when it reopens.
- Messages document `context` stays rejected until its model-visible semantics have an IR owner. Its lack of a carrier on other targets is not a reason to exclude it permanently.
- Generated media beyond the existing Chat audio contract need a selected output, stream and replay design. Standalone media tasks remain frozen.
- Hosted tools have observation types but no admitted end-to-end contract. Select one official tool before extending declarations, observations and continuation.
- Tool-result video has no carrier on any bound target: OpenAI and Interactions results have no video part, and Gemini function responses admit only images, PDF and plain text.

### 1C design: Messages citations

Counterexample: a request holds two PDF documents with `citations: {"enabled": true}`. The response cites `{"type":"page_location","document_index":1,"document_title":"B","cited_text":"…","start_page_number":2,"end_page_number":3}`, and the client sends that text block back with its citation next turn. The IR has page coordinates, but it cannot hold the per-document flag or the cited text. Nor can it name the second request document: `Citation.source` resolves only in its owner's resource table, and a response table does not contain request documents.

Protocol facts (pinned SDK; [Citations](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations) and [Search results](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/search-results), read 2026-10-13):

- `document_index` is 0-based over all document blocks in the request, across messages. `search_result_index` is 0-based over all `search_result` blocks, across messages and tool results.
- Character and block ranges are 0-based; pages are 1-based. All ends are exclusive.
- Citations are enabled on all or none of the documents, and likewise for search results. They are incompatible with structured output; the upstream enforces both.
- Messages cites whole text blocks: the response splits text at citation boundaries. `cited_text` is not billed as input or output.

Proposed structure for 1C-a, documents only:

| Concept | IR change |
|---|---|
| Enable flag | `FileDescription.citations: bool` per use. Messages carries it; other targets reject `true`, because it changes the output contract |
| Cited source | `Citation.source` becomes `CitationSource::Resource(ResourceId)` or `CitationSource::RequestDocument(ordinal)`. The ordinal counts the request's file uses in order; append-only history keeps it stable |
| Cited text | `Citation.quote: Option<Text>`, kept exactly |
| Location | Existing `SourceCoordinates` text, page and block ranges; the claim is `Whole` |
| Other targets | OpenAI carriers have no request-document citation. Response delivery to OpenAI clients drops it through a named rule; history that carries it is rejected by OpenAI targets, like other unrepresentable annotations |

1C-a exit condition: one hand-written Messages oracle each way for a cited PDF (request flag, response page citation, returned history), one streamed `citations_delta`, and an OpenAI target rejecting the flag. A bounded real call must confirm whether documents inside `tool_result` count toward `document_index` before the ordinal rule is final.

Later and separate (1C-b): `search_result` blocks as a new input part with `CitationSource::SearchResult(ordinal)`, and `content` documents made of text and image blocks. Neither has a carrier outside Messages. `web_search_result_location` belongs to Provider web search, not 1C.

The alternative is to keep 1C rejected until Claude Code acceptance: pi never sends citations, and opencode sends them only from part metadata.

The coverage-improvement pass starts only after IR completeness is established. Focused contract tests, safety invariants and the offline baseline remain required for every implementation slice; deferring the coverage pass does not defer those checks.

IR completeness does not mean every upstream can carry every modality. Protocol-specific carrier limits and the [pending decisions](#pending-decisions) remain explicit. This phase does not open file services, generated-image delivery or new Provider bindings.

## Planned order

1. **Generation IR completeness.** Complete the selected official semantic contracts, including input, output and history/replay. Keep deferred concepts explicit rather than claiming full API coverage or expanding frozen tasks.
2. **Stateful extension and coverage improvement.** After IR completeness, add stateful APIs in two forms, Provider-held state and gateway-held, time-limited `previous_response_id` history, and improve contract coverage. The IR keeps its response continuation types for this stage. No order between these two tracks is selected.
3. **Failover.** The feature remains in early design. Its priority is undecided, lowest for now; design, implementation improvement and real acceptance follow the second stage.
4. **Other agent acceptance.** Codex, Claude Code and other agents follow failover. Their priority is undecided, lowest for now.

This sequence does not select implementation slices or start deferred acceptance runs. Each later stage stays deferred until scheduled.

## Target clients

pi and opencode are the primary clients and real-client gates. Codex, Claude Code and other agent acceptance belong to the final planned stage, with priority undecided and lowest for now.

Pinned client behavior is an acceptance oracle alongside the protocol schema: parsing, stream merging, returned history and error classification. See [References](references.md), [pi acceptance](development.md#pi-acceptance) and [opencode acceptance](development.md#opencode-acceptance).

## Frozen scope

Maintenance only, when a refactor requires it:

- Standalone Images, Speech, Transcription and Embeddings.
- New Providers and model bindings unless an approved slice reopens them. Alternative bindings for an existing public model belong to failover work; activating a registered binding is not adding one.
- New subscription credential features.
- Stateful Responses until the second planned stage is scheduled.
- File services and Realtime.

### Not planned

- Raw wire passthrough, post-encoding JSON patches or weakened schemas.
- Invented tool results or changed roles for orphan results.
- Message-content hashes as conversation identity, or LLM classifiers for routing.
- Plugin hosts, middleware hosts or capabilities learned automatically from upstream errors.
- Load balancing, credential concurrency/RPM lanes or budget reservations.
- Retrying a refusal on another model.
- Routing below the declared conversation: turn detection, branch/subtask keys, per-turn holds or model switches, and per-message effort.

These boundaries follow [Failover](architecture.md#failover) and [Settled decisions](architecture.md#settled-decisions).

## Maintenance rules

Observed vendor stream shapes become named dialect rules only when a bound upstream emits them. Examples include empty continuation tool names or call IDs, empty finish reasons, and tool-call openers.

Treat a bound upstream's in-stream error as a classified failure, not normal output. Do not extend frozen media decoders as part of this work.

## Deferred acceptance

| Work | Scheduling | Exit condition when reopened |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage pass | Second stage, only after IR completeness | Independent wire→IR and IR→wire fixtures, synthetic upstreams and chunked SSE intake |
| Non-image multimodal real checks | Deferred acceptance after IR completeness | One bounded real check for each selected audio, video or document carrier, using model-issued history for tool results; no per-model or format matrix |
| Pinned-client image replay | Deferred, conditional acceptance | If the installed binary differs from the pinned source, run the bounded image tool round trip with a binary built from that revision; do not infer it from installed-client acceptance |
| Real failover | Third stage; priority undecided, lowest for now | One bounded real run for a model with two credentials or Providers and a reproducible advanceable failure |
| Codex and other agents | Final stage; priority undecided, lowest for now | Define the selected client's acceptance contract before reopening |
| Claude Code | Final stage; priority undecided, lowest for now | Sample real request shapes, then verify beta headers/query, token counting and user metadata hints; implement [1C](#1c-design-messages-citations) if the samples use citations |

The coverage pass covers text, tools, tool errors, reasoning replay, usage, truncation, error classes and media carriers (user and tool-result image, audio, video and document). It also checks client-facing fragment shapes and meaningful absent/null/empty distinctions. It does not authorize a variant matrix.

Codex, Claude Code and other agent acceptance are on hold until scheduled: no acceptance runs or request sampling before then.

Real failover needs a controlled failure source, such as an exhausted key in a scratch store. Functional tests and pi Messages acceptance do not prove Claude Code acceptance.

### Only if needed

- SSE keep-alive comments while initial frames are held.
- Prefix-derived executor affinity when no conversation is declared.
- An opt-in first-content timeout.

## Pending decisions

| Question | Current behavior | Options |
|---|---|---|
| File API (deferred) | Inline data or public URLs only. Inline media fit the IR budgets (12 MiB decoded per item, 32 MiB of IR per request), with narrower target limits where required. Client Provider file IDs and credential-owned file URIs are rejected; there is no gateway file service | Gateway store resolved to inline before lowering; upload pinned to one credential; or a gateway store with per-executor upstream upload. The first and last share one IR slot |

## Future work

- Stateful Responses in the second planned stage, after IR completeness.
- File services.
- Generated-image output with a selected semantic contract and downstream carrier; input support does not authorize this work.
- Resumed standalone media work.
- Realtime.
